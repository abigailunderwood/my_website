I am a PhD Student in the College of Social Work at The Ohio State Univeristy, currently in my second year of the program. My research interests include reproductive health, feminist social work, community-based methodologies, systems and population health. Currently I am working with Dr. Alicia Bunger on an implementation science project for an intervention that provides contraceptive counseling to teens in psychiatric care.  Additionally, I am working with Dr. Ayaz Hyder on a Community-Based Systems Dynamics project to understand how housing policy and structural racism affect birth outcomes in Linden, a neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio. I am a Health Policy Research Scholar with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. I also serve as the President of my college's doctoral student organization. 

I completed my Master of Social Work in 2020 and obtained my social work license.  Afterward, I worked as a Functional Family Therapist with adolescents and their families.  Prior to my MSW, I earned my BA in Latin American Studies and Urban Studies from Washington University in St. Louis.  When I am not studying or working on research, I spend time with my baby, Teddy, and my husband, Winston.
