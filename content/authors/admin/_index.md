I am a PhD Student in the [College of Social Work at The Ohio State Univeristy](https://csw.osu.edu/), currently in my second year of the program. My research interests include reproductive health, feminist social work, community-based methodologies, systems and population health. Currently I am working with [Dr. Alicia Bunger](https://csw.osu.edu/about/faculty-staff/faculty-directory/bunger-alicia-ph-d/) on an implementation science project for an intervention that provides contraceptive counseling to teens in psychiatric care.  Additionally, I am working with [Dr. Ayaz Hyder](https://cph.osu.edu/people/ahyder) on a Community-Based Systems Dynamics project to understand how housing policy and structural racism affect birth outcomes in Linden, a neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio. I am a [Health Policy Research Scholar](https://healthpolicyresearch-scholars.org/) with the [Robert Wood Johnson Foundation](www.rwjf.org). I also serve as the President of my college's doctoral student organization. 

I completed my Master of Social Work in 2020 and obtained my social work [license](https://elicense.ohio.gov/oh_verifylicensedetails?pid=a0Rt00000025o0mEAA).  Afterward, I worked as a Functional Family Therapist with adolescents and their families.  Prior to my MSW, I earned my BA in Latin American Studies and Urban Studies from Washington University in St. Louis.  When I am not studying or working on research, I spend time with my baby, Teddy, and my husband, [Winston](https://winstonunderwood.com/).
